# Breast-Cancer-detection-using-Logistic-Regression
Dataset
This project utilizes the breast_cancer.csv dataset, which contains diagnostic measurements of breast tissue samples. Each record includes multiple numerical attributes describing cell characteristics (e.g., radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness) along with a target label identifying the tumor as benign or malignant.

Methodology
The dataset undergoes preprocessing, including handling of missing values, feature scaling, and partitioning into training and testing subsets. A Logistic Regression model is then trained to classify tumor cases, and its performance is rigorously evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix to ensure robust and reliable predictions.
